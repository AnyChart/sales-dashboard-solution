# Sales Dashboard
## Wine Sale in France

This sample covers the basics of any sales dashboard.
We did our best to make it visually appealing and easy to grasp.

Bugs:

* Define Min/Max Size on Resize
* unselect method doesn't (or fails) in maps
* France map to be updated and fully implemented
* AnyChart map and js must come from cdn
* check and improve all aligns of all number columns
* Console errors
* chart.xAxis().labels().width('40%') - General tab (after switching pie to bar chart) 
* Bullet Chart bug (when the value more than scale.max - it isn't shown)
* Chart overselects on clicks
* Labels in Bar Charts doesn't fit - change type, implement better placement or formatting to cut lengthy la
* Decrease Titles fonts
* Proofread Charts Titles, Labels, etc.
* Labels are cut in Pie Charts
* Check how new interactivy features will fit when RC 7.7.0 is ready and probably add advanced settings

Wish list:

* Show Loading State
* Tooltip in SparkLine and Bullet Charts
